After you started the program, you can see a Overview of all fields.
All undrawed field are showing the text "**touch here to draw**".

Once you touched on a drawed picture, you will get a bigger view of the touched one. One click on this picture again, the program will show you the overview again.

In case, you touching a free field, a drawing area will appear, with some tools on the left side.

For example, if you want to change the color, or the size of the pencil, easily touch on the pencil icon and choose your desired options!
Moreover, you can erase some or all parts of the picture with the rubber icon.

Furthermore, you can just let the webcam take a picture of you, if you want! After you are fine with your work, just touch the save button.
If not, then touch the cancel button and nothing will be saved.

Besides, if the field area misfits you, just scroll and choose another free field and get your individual and aspired position in the DrawBook!

Have fun :)
